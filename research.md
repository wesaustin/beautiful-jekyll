[School Bus Emissions, Student Health, and Academic Performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775719301530) (with Dan Kreisman and Garth Heutel) **Economics of Education Review**. 2019.

   <blockquote> <p align="justify"> Diesel emissions from school buses expose children to high levels of air pollution; retrofitting bus engines can substantially reduce this exposure. Using variation from 2,656 retrofits across Georgia, we estimate effects of emissions reductions on district-level health and academic achievement. We demonstrate positive effects on respiratory health, measured by a statewide test of aerobic capacity. Placebo tests on body mass index show no impact. We also find that retrofitting districts experience significant test score gains in English and smaller gains in math. Our results suggest that engine retrofits can have meaningful and cost-effective impacts on health and cognitive functioning.<br></p> </blockquote>

[Path to the Principalship and Value Added: A Cross-state Comparison of Elementary and Middle School Principals](https://caldercenter.org/publications/path-principalship-and-value-added-cross-state-comparison-elementary-and-middle-school) (with Bingjie Chen, Dan Goldhaber, Eric Hanushek, Kristian Holden, Cory Koedel, Helen Ladd, Jin Luo, Eric Parsons, Gregory Phelan, Steven Rivkin, Tim Sass, Mavzuna Turaeva) **CALDER Working Paper No. 213-0119-1** 2019.

   <blockquote>
   <p align="justify"> An increasing emphasis on principals as key to school improvement has contributed to efforts to elevate principal effectiveness that have taken various forms across the US. The primacy of the state as the focal point of educational reform elevates the value of understanding commonalities and differences among states in characteristics of principals, the distribution of principals among schools and ultimately the policies associated with more effective school leadership, particularly for disadvantaged children. This paper describes major state policies, the distribution of elementary school principals among schools along a several dimensions, and pathways to the principalship to illustrate similarities and differences among six states in the tenure and experience distributions and how these vary by student demographic characteristics and district size. Measurement of principal effectiveness and its relationship with principal characteristics and state policies would be ideal, but complications introduced by the dynamics of principal influences and confounding effects of other factors inhibit this effort. Nonetheless, school value added to achievement provides information on differences in principal effectiveness, and we report within-school variation value added across principal regimes and the associations between value added and principal characteristics. The analysis reveals many similarities and some differences among the states, some of which are related to differences in governance structures. Perhaps the most striking differences relate to the pathways to the principalship including the fraction of principals with experiences as assistant principals and teachers.

School Bus Diesel Emissions and Academic Performance: A National Study 

   <details><summary> Abstract (+) </summary>
   <blockquote>
   <p align="justify"> 
Prior work shows that air pollution affects cognitive performance, and school bus diesel emissions meaningfully contribute to this exposure for school-age children. I exploit variation in the timing and location of 28,000 school bus engine retrofits or replacements across the US from 2008-2016 to test how reducing diesel emissions affects student test scores. I also incorporate satellite-based PM 2.5 measurements from the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group to provide the first evidence that these engine retrofits significantly reduce ambient atmospheric pollution levels, suggesting potentially large spillover benefits from the retrofits separate from the student test score improvements. Finally, I ask how the cost of retrofitting these busses, approximately $233 million over 209 unique grant cycles, compares to the monetized benefits of the observed test score improvements.

 Coal Combustion Residuals, Water Quality, and Fetal Health.

   <details><summary> Abstract (+) </summary>
   <blockquote>
   <p align="justify">
Coal ash accounts for one third of industrial water pollution in the United States. No previous study has investigated how this form of water pollution may impact municipal water quality. I link information on coal ash surface water discharges from the Toxic Releases Inventory to three relevant outcomes: surface water quality measurements from the National Water Inventory System, the universe of municipal water quality monitoring tests in North Carolina, and an individual birth data-set with mother’s identifiers and addresses linked to municipal water service zones. Identification relies on geographic variation in “downstream” status of monitoring sites and municipal water intake locations within small watershed regions. I also incorporate variation in daily water discharge, temperature, and the relative quantity of coal ash released to secure causal identification. I find that coal ash releases increase specific conductance in both downstream surface waters and municipal water supplies sourced from these waters. Municipal water systems affected by coal ash tend to have higher levels of disinfection byproducts, inorganic chemicals such as lead, and acidity. The paper concludes with an estimation of the effects of coal ash water pollution on fetal health, exploiting variation in water quality across siblings that may arise from shifting water providers, family moves, and fluctuations in water quality within the same provider.

Farm-to-School Programs and Local Agricultural Revenues (with George William Davis). 

   <details><summary> Abstract (+) </summary>
   <blockquote>
   <p align="justify"> 
   Farm-to-school programs exist in every state. A central goal of these programs is to source school food from local farms and businesses. Proponents argue that such sourcing helps local businesses while improving school nutritional quality. I link school-district information on adoption of farm-to-school policies to a unique commodity-by-county survey of agricultural products to test for local economic effects of farm-to-school programs. Identification comes from spatiotemporal variation in school-district adoption of the policy, where I purge selection bias with a dosage treatment variable related to the number of students served by farm-to-school districts in neighboring counties. Preliminary results suggest that farm-to-school policies are responsible for 10-20% of the increase in farm revenues across the state of Georgia from 2001-2017, or roughly $750 million. The revenue increase is concentrated in eggs, dairy, and meats; surprisingly, revenues for fruits and vegetables appear unrelated to policy adoption even when breaking out the analysis by individual types of fruit or vegetable. I next link information on school-district nutritional expenditures and employ a standard difference-in-difference statistical model to show that these local economic effects come with no observable increase in total or per-pupil nutritional outlays, suggesting that school districts are primarily switching to more-local food providers.
