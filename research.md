1. [School Bus Emissions, Student Health, and Academic Performance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775719301530) (with Dan Kreisman and Garth Heutel) **Economics of Education Review**. 2019.

   <blockquote> <p align="justify"> Diesel emissions from school buses expose children to high levels of air pollution; retrofitting bus engines can substantially reduce this exposure. Using variation from 2,656 retrofits across Georgia, we estimate effects of emissions reductions on district-level health and academic achievement. We demonstrate positive effects on respiratory health, measured by a statewide test of aerobic capacity. Placebo tests on body mass index show no impact. We also find that retrofitting districts experience significant test score gains in English and smaller gains in math. Our results suggest that engine retrofits can have meaningful and cost-effective impacts on health and cognitive functioning.<br></p> </blockquote>

1. [Path to the Principalship and Value Added: A Cross-state Comparison of Elementary and Middle School Principals](https://caldercenter.org/publications/path-principalship-and-value-added-cross-state-comparison-elementary-and-middle-school) (with Bingjie Chen, Dan Goldhaber, Eric Hanushek, Kristian Holden, Cory Koedel, Helen Ladd, Jin Luo, Eric Parsons, Gregory Phelan, Steven Rivkin, Tim Sass, Mavzuna Turaeva) **CALDER Working Paper No. 213-0119-1** 2019.

   <blockquote>
   <p align="justify"> 
   Farm-to-school programs exist in every state.A central goal of these programs is to source school food from local farms and businesses. Proponents argue that such sourcing helps local businesses while improving school nutritional quality. I link school-district information on adoption of farm-to-school policies to a unique commodity-by-county survey of agricultural products to test for local economic effects of farm-to-school programs. Identification comes from spatiotemporal variation in school-district adoption of the policy, where I purge selection bias with a dosage treatment variable related to the number of students served by farm-to-school districts in neighboring counties. Preliminary results suggest that farm-to-school policies are responsible for 10-20% of the increase in farm revenues across the state of Georgia from 2001-2017, or roughly $750 million. The revenue increase is concentrated in eggs, dairy, and meats; surprisingly, revenues for fruits and vegetables appear unrelated to policy adoption even when breaking out the analysis by individual types of fruit or vegetable. I next link information on school-district nutritional expenditures and employ a standard difference-in-difference statistical model to show that these local economic effects come with no observable increase in total or per-pupil nutritional outlays, suggesting that school districts are primarily switching to more-local food providers.

1. Coal Combustion Residuals, Water Quality, and Fetal Health.

   <blockquote>
   <p align="justify"> Coal ash accounts for one third of industrial water pollution in the United States.  No previous study hasinvestigated how this form of water pollution may impact municipal water quality.  I geographically linkthe universe of municipal water quality tests in North Carolina to information on coal ash discharges fromthe Toxic Releases Inventory to demonstrate the average relationship between surface water releases andmunicipal water quality.  Then, incorporating information on heavy rains and flooding from the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, I show how these relatively common weather events exacerbatethe risk of ash pond impounds impacting municipal water quality.  Finally, I estimate the cost of coal ashwater pollution in terms of municipal water system fines for water quality violations, finding that theburden of coal ash pollution on municipal water systems in North Carolina is approximately $950,000,or one fifth of all fines assessed from 2005-2017<br></p> </blockquote>
