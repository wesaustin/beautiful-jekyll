Hi! Welcome to my page. I am a doctoral candidate in economics at Georgia State University. My research primarily focuses on environmental topics, with a special interest in how air and water quality influence human health and cognitive performance. 

I will be available for interview at the ASSA Annual Conference in San Diego, January 3 -5, 2020. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to learn more.
